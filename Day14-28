### Week 3: GitHub Mastery and C# Integration

**Days 15-17: Git Wizardry**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Master the intricate dance of branching, merging, and rebasing in Git – the version control system that underpins modern software development.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * We'll explore how to create branches to work on features in isolation, then merge those branches back into the main codebase.
    * Conflicts are inevitable. We'll learn how to resolve them gracefully, understanding their impact on the project's history.
    * Git commands like `stash`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, and `reset` will become your allies, allowing you to manipulate commits and changes with precision.
    * Imagine having a time machine for your code – that's essentially what Git provides, and we'll learn how to harness its full power.

**Days 18-20: C# and GitHub: A Dynamic Duo**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Seamlessly integrate your C# projects with GitHub to leverage version control and foster collaboration.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * We'll establish a workflow where every change you make to your C# code is automatically tracked by Git.
    * GitHub Actions will become your automated assistant, running tests and building your code whenever you push changes.
    * Collaborate with others through pull requests and code reviews.  Imagine receiving feedback on your code from experienced developers around the world!

**Day 21: Real-World Collaboration**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Step into the vibrant world of open-source development on GitHub.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * Contribute your skills to existing projects or create your own. The open-source community is vast and welcoming!
    * Utilize GitHub's project management tools to track tasks and communicate with your team.
    * Document your workflows and share your knowledge.  You'll be giving back to the community while solidifying your understanding.

### Week 4: Advanced Automation and Organizational Prowess

**Days 22-23: GitBash and PowerShell Meet GitHub**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Streamline your Git operations by harnessing the combined power of GitBash, PowerShell, and GitHub.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * We'll clone repositories, create branches, and resolve conflicts directly from the command line, making you a Git ninja!
    * Let's write scripts that automate Git actions, such as pushing changes to GitHub or creating new branches based on specific conditions.
    * Git hooks will become your secret weapon, allowing you to trigger custom scripts when certain events occur in your Git workflow.

**Days 24-25: The Zen of Digital Organization**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Embark on a journey to achieve a state of digital Zen by implementing advanced filing techniques.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * We'll design a folder structure that reflects your projects and workflows, making it easy to find what you need.
    * Consistent naming conventions and version control will ensure that you never lose track of file changes.
    * Imagine having a search engine for your files – that's what file indexing can achieve. We'll explore techniques for optimizing file search.

**Day 26: C# Masterclass**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Delve deeper into the nuances of C#, tackling more advanced programming concepts.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * We'll refine your understanding of LINQ, async/await, generics, and delegates, making you a more versatile C# developer.
    * Writing efficient and maintainable code is an art. We'll discuss optimization techniques, code readability, and best practices for testing.

**Day 27: Scripting Symphony**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Orchestrate a symphony of automation using scripting techniques.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * Picture a script that automatically deploys your code to a server, runs tests, and sends you a notification – that's the kind of automation we'll achieve!
    * We'll set up cron jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run your scripts on schedule, freeing you from repetitive tasks.
    * Your knowledge of Git, GitBash, PowerShell, and C# will converge as we create comprehensive automation workflows.

**Day 28: Mastery Project**

* **Apprentice's Task:**  Demonstrate your newfound expertise by building a capstone project that integrates all the skills you've acquired.
* **Mentor's Guidance:**
    * This is your chance to shine! Choose a project that excites you – it could be a command-line tool, a web application, or even a game.
    * We'll work together to design a project that incorporates environmental variables, directories, GitBash, PowerShell, GitHub, C#, and digital filing organization techniques.
    * The final project is not just about the end product – it's about the journey of learning and growth. Document your process and share your insights.

### Weeks 5 & 6 (Optional): Pushing the Boundaries

* **Advanced Git Workflows:**  Explore GitFlow, GitHub Flow, and other branching strategies used by professional teams.
* **GitHub API:**  Learn to interact with GitHub programmatically to automate tasks and create custom integrations.
* **C# Design Patterns:**  Master design patterns to write elegant, reusable, and maintainable code.
* **Advanced PowerShell:**  Dive into PowerShell modules, Desired State Configuration (DSC), and other advanced features.
* **Cloud Integration:**  Explore integrating your workflows with cloud platforms like Azure or AWS.
