My nickname is Frieza but I'm actually a nice guy. 
haha Today (07/13/2024)
I created a VHD named (J:) 

because I like that letter and thought it would be cool 
to commit from Git beginning with J:\ instead of C:\ 

I hope 50GB is enough. 

Today I will be reviewing all Administrative Events from my Local
& creating system fixes for my local. 
Many of the issues are stemming from AppReadiness & DCOM.

Today (07/15/2024)

I became part of Windows Insider Program in Dev. I followed all instruction, along with HP
since this is my BIOS/UEFI. Within this, I changed my download path along with all permission
and the directory away from /jeffd/_something_something
and did two things: 

#1 Updated, cleaned, processed, configured, and allowed permissions to the D:, J:, and allow
separate drives to serve different purposes. C: for it's purpose, J: for running one VM
and D: appears to be a contained space for Windows 11 Dev Mode.

The main purpose I feel like it to maintain operational integrity of my laptop, maintaining
optimal speeds & efficiencies once the coding development begins. 

//side note, over the years
I really never "got" software dev or the lifecycle or why so many acronyms are used. For me,
it started with a single URL affiliate thought and how would I build, generate, and obtain 
clicks and buys from that link. In short, being a digital "door to door salesman, postman, etc."
//
Since I feel like I'm more aware of the Users end, upon attempting to create traffic to the URL,
I feel like along the way it brought me back to something I have been trying to "get". Get all 
the details of JS, CSS, etc. and the genesis of it all is from a single URL. For me, I feel
like creating a product (from a URL) from end to end I have a greater appreciation for 
everything that goes into a URL, website, domain building, SEO, etc. etc.
